    <h2>Self-servicing car wash</h2>
    <p>A self-serve car wash is a simple and automated type of car wash that is typically coin-operated or </br>token-operated self-service system. Newer self-service car washes offer the ability to pay with credit cards or loyalty cards.</br> The vehicle is parked inside a large covered bay that is equipped with a trigger gun and wand </br>(a high-pressure sprayer) as well as a foam brush for scrubbing. When customers insert coins or tokens into the coin box, </br>they can choose options such as soap, tire cleaner, wax or clear water rinse, all dispensed from the sprayer, or scrub the vehicle with</br> the foam brush. The number of coins or tokens inserted determines the amount of time customers have to operate the equipment; </br>in most instances, a minimum number of coins is necessary to start the equipment. These facilities are often equipped with separate vacuum </br>stations that allow customers to clean the upholstery and rugs inside their cars. Some self-service car washes offer hand-held dryers.</p>
